## First Post

Hello everyone! Welcome to my blog!  
I attended DEF CON 28 Safe Mode this past week, and the thing I kept hearing was “create a blog.” Well, here it is. I will be posting anything related to Cyber Security or anything else I find interesting. This weekend, I am planning to make a post in regards to my review of my first DEF CON.  
  
I also have some other blog posts planned: Two Hacker Boxes reviews, DEF CON workshop reviews, and more.
I hope you enjoy the content and hopefully can network with you guys on both Twitter and LinkedIn.
