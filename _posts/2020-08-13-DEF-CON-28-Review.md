# DEF CON 28 aka DEF CON IS CANCELLED aka DEF CON SAFE MODE

A little less than one week ago, DEF CON 28 ended. This was my first DEF CON I have to attend, and due to COVID-19, it was the first virtual DEF CON. For me, it was a fascinating few days meeting people as well as attending workshops and sessions. There was a total of 32 villages this year with new villages (Payment Village, Payments Village Workshop, and Password Village). Outside of focusing on the Red, Blue, and Password Village, I wanted to attend my first CTF.  

[OpenSOC](https://opensoc.io/) provided training on Thursday, August 6th, for their open-source tools that would be used during the CTF. They included Graylog, Kibana, Moloch, Osquery, Velociraptor, Zeek, Suricata, and Thinkst Canary. I enjoyed these sessions as I am looking to move into a SOC position. During the CTF on Friday, there were quite a few issues with the server getting overloaded. They even had to close it down early Friday evening and opening it back up on Saturday. Here is a good write up on the OpenSOC CTF: [https://pberba.github.io/security/2020/08/11/defcon-28-blueteam-opensoc-ctf/](https://pberba.github.io/security/2020/08/11/defcon-28-blueteam-opensoc-ctf/)  

As far as the workshops, I had three favorite workshops:
1.	[Omar Santos](https://twitter.com/santosomar) – N00b Intro to Building Your Own Lab
2.	[Ben Hughes](https://twitter.com/CyberPraesidium), [Fred Mastrippolito](https://twitter.com/politoinc) – Deploying PiHole: More than an Ad Blocker
3.	[Sam Bowne](https://twitter.com/sambowne), [Elizabeth Biddlecome](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebiddlecome/), [Kaitlyn Handelman](https://twitter.com/kaitlynguru), [Irvin Lemus](https://twitter.com/InfoSecIrvin) – Incident Response and the ATT&CK Matrix  

I do have the sessions recorded; however, I don’t have the PowerPoint slides for all three. I am going to follow up with all three, and if they are okay, I will post the recordings of the sessions.

## DEF CON Going Forward  
  
I am already making my plans to attend DEF CON 29 in Vegas. This will be my first one in Vegas, in person. I am going to try to network with as many people as possible now. Once I get to Vegas, I can meet some of these people in person.
